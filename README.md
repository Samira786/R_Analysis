### MPG Regression

Based on the results, vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance due to the significant impact on mpg. The slope of the linear model is very close to zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11, which is smaller than the 0.05. This linear model predicts mpg of prototypes effectively by 71% because the r-squared value is 0.71.

### Suspension Coil

Lot size 3 exceeds 100 pounds per inch as the variance of Lot 3 is 170.

### Suspension Coil T-Test

P-value of Lot 1 - 1
P-value of Lot 2 - 0.6072
P-value of Lot 3 - 0.04168

Mean value of Lot 1 - 1500
Mean value of Lot 2 - 1500.2
Mean value of Lot 3 - 1496.14

Based on the output for Lot 3, the mean of the suspension coilâ€™s pound-per-inch is  1496.14. 95 percent confidence interval indicated that the mean from Lot 3 can be from 1492.431 to 1499.849. The p-value is 0.04168 indicating the mean pounds per inch was 1500. The Lot 3 p-value is less than 0.05.

The probability of selecting a sample with a mean equal to this one would be approximately 4%.

### Conclusion - the null hypothesis is rejected.

Own Study

Is Performance of the car is determined by MPG and Horsepower?
The null hypothesis - horsepower has no effect on mpg
Alternate hypothesis - horsepower has effect on mpg

Conclusion - the null hypothesis is rejected
